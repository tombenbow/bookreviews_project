          "I admit it, I never read 1984 until I was 32. It has a reputation of being a boring mandatory school book on a par with Of Mice And Men and Shakespeare, as a result I never went anywhere near it.\n\n    Wow, I was missing out!\n    \n    Yes, 1984 is a fascinating political treatise... but more importantly it’s a gloriously gripping novel. Characters are relatable, interesting and tragic, you really root for them and invest in what they’re going through. The imagery is evocative and the plot is full of twists and turns despite all of us knowing about Room 101, Big Brother etc from day to day life. I was up all night and read it in one sitting, literally couldn’t put it down.\n    \n    Don’t make the same mistake I did, don’t ignore it as a ‘boring’ or ‘dry’ - read it!",

          "I sat on the plane reading this book. The chap next to me had an iPhone, the lady on the opposite aisle had an iPad, and the lady by the opposite window had an iPhone. It brought home the impact this man had on the world.\n\n    Steve Jobs was one crazy guy. He was into spirituality, but he didn't seem to be spiritual at all really. In a weird way he spiritualised products while denigrating fellow human beings. He served humanity by making elegant technology, not by maintaining healthy relationships with those around him.\n    \n    From a business perspective, it was inspiring to read about his commitment to the vision: the passion for simplicity. The founding of the Apple store, the drive and courage to produce the iPod, iPad and iPhone, the stories are powerful and uplifting . Indeed the story is a big part of his business success - Ross Perot paraphrased it and got a lot of it wrong, but people wanted to retell it because it inspired people.\n    \n    His genius for selling manifested at his product launches. He was at ease making multi-million dollar deals. He didn't try and play God - there were loads of people who felt cheated by him, but he wasn't bothered. The Pixar subplot was astonishing. To have played such a role in animation, on top of everything else, was just incredible.\n    \n    But as a human being, he was an untreated compulsive. He was insanely fussy in his demands of Apple technologists, but he showed the same attitude to the people who cooked for him, or treated him for his illness.\n    \n    I loved the book and read it in a week. I feel I need to have a bigger vision for my life and business for the next 10 years - so I'm grateful for that.",

          "This book outdoes the author's previous work Black Box Thinking. It is well written full of insights and fascinating anecdotes. The focus of the book is the benefit of using diversity in all its forms from culture to mind set to solve complex promlems more effectively and gain competitive advantage. In passing, it clarifies some mysteries. For example the section on the science of diet is a new insight and sufficient in itself to justify the cover price.",
