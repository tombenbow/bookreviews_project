      "I admit it, I never read 1984 until I was 32. It has a reputation of being a boring mandatory school book on a par with Of Mice And Men and Shakespeare, as a result I never went anywhere near it.\n\n    Wow, I was missing out!\n    \n    Yes, 1984 is a fascinating political treatise... but more importantly it’s a gloriously gripping novel. Characters are relatable, interesting and tragic, you really root for them and invest in what they’re going through. The imagery is evocative and the plot is full of twists and turns despite all of us knowing about Room 101, Big Brother etc from day to day life. I was up all night and read it in one sitting, literally couldn’t put it down.\n    \n    Don’t make the same mistake I did, don’t ignore it as a ‘boring’ or ‘dry’ - read it!",

      "I sat on the plane reading this book. The chap next to me had an iPhone, the lady on the opposite aisle had an iPad, and the lady by the opposite window had an iPhone. It brought home the impact this man had on the world.\n\n    Steve Jobs was one crazy guy. He was into spirituality, but he didn't seem to be spiritual at all really. In a weird way he spiritualised products while denigrating fellow human beings. He served humanity by making elegant technology, not by maintaining healthy relationships with those around him.\n    \n    From a business perspective, it was inspiring to read about his commitment to the vision: the passion for simplicity. The founding of the Apple store, the drive and courage to produce the iPod, iPad and iPhone, the stories are powerful and uplifting . Indeed the story is a big part of his business success - Ross Perot paraphrased it and got a lot of it wrong, but people wanted to retell it because it inspired people.\n    \n    His genius for selling manifested at his product launches. He was at ease making multi-million dollar deals. He didn't try and play God - there were loads of people who felt cheated by him, but he wasn't bothered. The Pixar subplot was astonishing. To have played such a role in animation, on top of everything else, was just incredible.\n    \n    But as a human being, he was an untreated compulsive. He was insanely fussy in his demands of Apple technologists, but he showed the same attitude to the people who cooked for him, or treated him for his illness.\n    \n    I loved the book and read it in a week. I feel I need to have a bigger vision for my life and business for the next 10 years - so I'm grateful for that.",

The focus of the book is the benefit of using diversity in all its forms from culture to mind set to solve complex promlems more effectively and gain competitive advantage. In passing, it clarifies some mysteries. For example the section on the science of diet is a new insight and sufficient in itself to justify the cover price.",

      "I love the chimp paradox. I have recommended it so many times to people. A really simple way of understanding our brains and the way we think. I happen to love my 'chimp' who I named Derek, but joking aside it's been helpful to my life to understand whether I am making a decision based on logic or emotion and although Derek's emotions can often creep in, I've learnt to think things through and think more logically before I let my emotions take over. I cannot recommend this highly enough. What I will say is it may take you several takes or readings to get into it BUT when the time is right YOU WILL GET IT and I promise it will be worth it. I love a kindle version, but I would recommend buying as an actual book as then you can make notes or highlights and go back to it again and again...",

      'This book is a "must read" for all users of social media, especially teenagers using Facebook and Twitter. A timely reminder that user control is an illusion and internet platforms rely for their "success" on unrelenting psychological appeal to basic human instincts. They promote extremism and fake news through Twitter and Facebook Groups, and aim to modify attitudes and behaviour. The potential for electoral interference is plain to see. All the platforms work in similar, though in most cases less extreme ways, and all agree that regulation would destroy their business models and hence their share price, so they resist it and use almost totally spurious arguments to make their case. But international regulation must come, and the sooner the better.',

      "Why do people buy extended warranties that are bad value for money?\n    Why do we marry people just because they're good in bed?\n    Why do investors snatch small profits from winning investments whilst allowing large losses to build up in bad investments?\n    Why do parents deny their children life saving vaccinations for fear of unproven risks?\n    Why do we think a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush?\n    \n    On the whole humans are incredibly good at making bad decisions because they allow emotions and moral values to prevail over good sense and simple mathematical calculation. We make snap decisions based on our intuition (fast thinking) and often believe our intuition is superior to logic (slow thinking). For example, President Trump recently said he preferred to listen to his 'gut' than his advisors.\n    \n    Kahneman examines the reasons why we make bad decisions and indicates ways in which we might make better decisions - even if the better decisions make us feel uncomfortable because they are counterintuitive.\n    \n    My only problem with this book is that it is so laborious in places that I almost lost interest. Sometimes Kahneman goes on and on about a proposition that has (at least for me) zero interest. If he asks 'How much would you pay for a bowl of roses valued at $59?' I don't have an answer because I'm simply not interested and I don't want to know how much anyone else would pay, or why they would or wouldn't pay it. Perhaps it's just me, but I found some of the propositions too complex to bother with. But to be fair there were some chapters that had me spellbound - maybe because they touched on areas where I make bad decisions.\n    \n    Overall, this is an important book but spoiled by too much dense argument and irrelevant illustration. It could have contained all the salient points and been reduced to half the length without any dilution of the message.",

This book is not just about the murders but delves into the psyche of the murderers and makes you think about how things are just not black and white, there is a lot of grey as well.

      'This book has added so much light to my view of the world. It has helped build a better picture of the truth about humanity and nature. You will likely find yourself reflecting on the past and becoming more aware in the present and future situations. Really this is a book that builds on the Darwinian theory of evolution. The "title" most certainly does not fully reflect the content and this is well explained by Richard Dawkins in the book.\n\n    While the book as a whole is very interesting and the way which Richard Dawkins writes, the simple and complex logic is beautiful. One of the brilliant examples is when he explains evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) in the human context. Saying that there are 3 kinda of people, the fool, the cheater and the grudger. Really thought provoking and a book worth reading not just once.\n    \n    If this is the standard Richard Dawkins has I will surely read all of his books.',

      "Startlingly lucid and wise - a much underrated virtue - Picketty’s tome is a delight to read, albeit in small doses.\n\n    His long run ‘serial history’ data are remarkably clear, with useful 2 line summaries of the main inferences.\n    \n    As many readers will know, Picketty’s view is that in normal circumstances (ie peace), inequality will increase because private capital grows faster than national income. (However, research on eight centuries of real interest rates, by P. Schmelzing and published by the Bank of England in 2020, showed a continuous trend line of declining real returns on capital, which implies that there are forces acting against the steady concentration of wealth and hence tending to reduce inequality.) The world war years of 1914-1945 and the subsequent two decades in the West were anomalies in that public spending and the public good trumped private capitalist accumulation. Now, says Picketty, we are back to ‘normal’ inequitable times.\n    \n    Picketty proposes a progressive, annual tax on wealth to promote equality and the broader public good - but acknowledges that this requires a degree of international cooperation and solidarity which is highly unlikely.\n    \n    Picketty also lambasts the sterile mathematical obsession of many economists, emphasising that economics is a ‘subdiscipline of the social sciences’ and cannot be separated from politics and history. It is about human behaviour, and how to run things so as to promote an ideal society. This begs all sorts of questions, but puts economics firmly in the moral, political and philosophical realm - not that of an objective ‘science’.\n    \n    As a former macroeconomic forecaster, I applaud Picketty for his intelligent and wide realism.\n    \n    As a concerned citizen, I wish fervently that our casino capitalist, over-consuming society was able to agree on reforming our market economy system before it collapses - and before we are turned irredeemably into zombie slaves of our shallowest desires.",

I realize that marketing is necessary for promoting this idea, and I understood what the authors were getting at with "extreme ownership", and many of their ideas had a depth that is missing in traditional leadership lessons, but at times the term was overused. It would have been good if the authors attached more fine detail to the concept rather than throwing "extreme ownership" at every situation. However, all in all, it is an excellent book and the authors are onto something. Too bad it takes a war to understand some of the finer details of leadership!',

      "Sorry, but I did not like this book. The best thing I can say is that it is well-written, very fluent and conversational as one would expect from a top New Yorker writer. I have never read anything else by Malcolm Gladwell as far as I know, but I was curious and even a bit excited to try this out because he is so well known for influential books such as The Tipping Point.\n\n    However, I'm afraid this book has nothing to say. It is a compendium of interesting crime cases and celebrated moments from history and popular culture, ranging from Hitler to Friends to 9/11 and a whole load of controversial court cases, with some examination of suicide as a diversion. For the first half of it - and it's a very quick read, so do give it a try if you are inclined to doubt my criticism - I just found myself wondering: “where is he going with this? What is the thesis? What is his point?”\n    \n    Ostensibly the book is about whether or not we can judge strangers. I think. But many of the examples that he draws on have no apparent lesson. Many of them are nice little vignettes which show how broad-ranging the author's mind is, and would make good “dinner party anecdotes” - but rather in a mansplaining vein, where you tell someone that what they think about Chamberlain and Hitler is so wrong because there's so much more to it... But actually they’re right.\n    \n    There are digressions via Cuban spies, Bernie Madoff, Jerry Sandusky and Amanda Knox. All nicely told. But what does the book actually tell us? Sorry Mr Gladwell. I got nothing.",

I'm not an economist nor psychologist, though my own profession includes a lot that crosses over into those fields - and would probably do better is there was greater cross-over.\n    Specialists often get blinkered, or even blinded, by their own field's theories that they fail to see the real world. I recall a sign I once saw \"That's all very well in practice but it will never work in theory!\" We need to remain open to ideas that contradict our own comfortable world and be prepared to accept change.

None of these are really covered on this book. While it contains a lot of useful and interesting guidance and insight into Google, it's also a bit of a sales pitch for how great Google is - without covering any of the conflicts or real issues the firm has.\n\n    Oh, and the very weak American humour becomes quite grating after a while - for me at least!\n    \n    For me, 'In the Plex' by Stephen Levy and 'Work Rules' by Laszlo Bock are better reads with better insight.

      'This is a very interesting book, intended as a sort of autobiography. It is based on a series of spoken interviews, in which Fidel Castro answered questions - and his responses were recoded then typed-up. The process took quite some time, and the level of depth and detail in this book is rather impressive.\n\n    The questions asked, and the responses given, have been placed in a thematic order in the book - so, for example, there\'s a section on Castro\'s youth, a section on his views concerning welfare, social & health care, and a section of the Cuban revolution, etc.. This structuring allows a reader to easily locate a particular "topic", and access the desired information.\n    \n    This book was written when Fidel was still President of Cuba. It explores - in detail - the 50 years he had, up to that point, been in office. Yet the questions are highly diverse, and Fidel was apparently willing to discuss any "topic" asked of him.\n    \n    This is a big book - over 700 pages in length - and is very well written. Given that the focus of this book - the life and thought of Fidel Castro - is of real importance (as he was a major figure in 20th century world history), this book deserves to be read.',

      "Although the examples are obviously not those of modern industries the principles are fundamental to all ages. Some of the ideas take a second or third reading to become clear, partly due my probable lack of intellect and also due to the style of writing. But that shouldn't deter anyone from purchasing this classic book.",

      "Having read the Authors previous books I have been anticipating the arrival of There is no planet B for sometime.\n\n    The book is packed full of information that is clearly explained and supported with numerous graphs, tables, charts and graphics. It is well organised and discusses topics such as should I buy an electric car, when might we emigrate to another planet and what 14 things should a politician know about climate change.\n    \n    The book stands out from others on a similar subject because it looks at the problems we all face from several different angles. It looks at the day to day things and also the wider questions of economics and social values.\n    \n    A very interesting and entertaining read that I would recommend to anyone who wants a realistic and well considered discussion around climate change and the environment.",

      'I enjoyed the book, however not as much as I had expected. Too much gossip and general topics but not any real "meaty bits" to excite. Sir Alex has made an effort to portray himself as an "angel" and according to his story the notorious happenings never really occurred. He also seemed to convey that many of the controversial decisions/events that took place where not of his making.\n    I am still glad that I read it as I was (and am) a great fan of the man, he is sorely missed both by Manchester United and the football world as a whole.',

      "Almost as engaging to read as Mike Tyson was to watch, this book really laid bare the way an individual as complex as Mike Tyson thinks. Having watched him in various interviews, I found myself imagining Tyson's voice reading this book to me as I went; the way the sentences are structured, the language used, and the open and candid nature of the descriptions of the numerous experiences he had throughout his career and personal life, all contribute to an intriguing - and brutally honest - account of the life and lifestyle of the most famous Heavyweight Champion of the World. Highly recommended.",

    title: "The Great Gatsby",

    body_of_review:
      "The Great Gatsby is simultaneously a romantic and cynical novel about the lives and unfulfillment of a group of wealthy New Yorkers during the roaring 20s. Fitzgerald paints a grim portrait of shallow characters who maneuver themselves into complex situations. The self-made Gatsby is relentless in pursuance of his dreams, an avant-garde prelude to the notion of the American Dream, hence his assigned ‘Great’-ness. The writing is littered with social commentary and cynical truths that were so ahead of their time, they remain relevant now (100 years on).\n\n    Whilst the story is intricate and follows complex characters, with a technically flawless writing style and plot, occasionally I found myself bored while reading it. The shallow and careless characters are difficult to empathise with. Although, for a Classic, I found this to be accessible. I have gleaned more enjoyment as I’ve reread this novel – for example the subtle homoerotic tendencies of the narrator “Nick”.\n    \n    If you found this review helpful, please do rate it as helpful – really helps me out!",
